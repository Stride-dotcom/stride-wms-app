# Locked Decision Ledger

Last updated: 2026-02-14
Owner: Builders / Developers
Scope: Development artifact only (not an app feature)

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative, human-readable decision ledger for build work.
It captures high-impact implementation decisions, their status, and supersession chain.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Editable until locked**: A decision can be edited while in `draft` or `accepted`.
2. **Locked means immutable**: Once state is `locked`, do not edit decision content in place.
3. **Changes after lock require supersession**: Create a new decision and reference `supersedes`.
4. **Append-only implementation tracking**: Progress is logged in `docs/LOCKED_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
5. **Decision source required**: Each decision must reference source material (Q&A, plan doc, PDF, issue).
6. **Docs-only system**: Ledger lives in this GitHub repo under `docs/` for builders/developers.

## Decision lifecycle states

- `draft`: captured candidate, still being refined
- `accepted`: approved for implementation, still editable
- `locked`: final and immutable
- `superseded`: replaced by another decision
- `rejected`: intentionally not adopted

## Post-import working decisions

### DL-2026-02-14-051: Subscription enforcement scope moves to full-app restriction with payment-update redirect
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-018, DL-2026-02-14-019, DL-2026-02-14-048, DL-2026-02-14-050
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
When subscription enforcement triggers, users should be routed to a subscription payment update page and blocked from normal app access until payment information is updated and access is restored.

#### Why
Business intent is to make subscription remediation the immediate path instead of route-by-route operational gating.

#### Implementation impact
- Introduces app-level restriction flow instead of limited route wrappers.
- Requires a dedicated payment-update destination route/page and allowlist behavior.
- Requires supersession plan for Phase 5 route-level gate decisions.

### DL-2026-02-14-052: Full-app redirect starts immediately at past_due (during grace)
- Domain: SaaS Enforcement
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-024
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Users are redirected to the subscription payment-update path immediately when status becomes `past_due` (during grace), not only after grace expires.

#### Why
Business priority is hard enforcement of billing remediation flow as soon as payment failure occurs.

#### Implementation impact
- Redefines grace as a payment-recovery window rather than an access-allowed window.
- App-level gate condition must block normal app routes for `past_due`, `canceled`, and `inactive`.
- Requires supersession-aware updates to banner/copy so in-grace users are still blocked but informed of grace deadline.

### DL-2026-02-14-053: Blocked page must auto-check subscription recovery and allow manual status refresh
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
The blocked payment-update page should automatically re-check subscription status on an interval (target ~10 seconds) and also provide a manual "Check status" action.

#### Why
Stripe recovery events are asynchronous; users need a low-friction path to regain access quickly once payment is fixed.

#### Implementation impact
- Add polling/refetch behavior to blocked flow.
- Add manual status refresh control on blocked page.
- On recovered status, immediately release app-level restriction and continue normal app navigation.

### DL-2026-02-14-054: Blocked-user destination route is /subscription/update-payment
- Domain: SaaS UX
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
The enforced payment-recovery flow uses a dedicated app route: `/subscription/update-payment`.

#### Why
A dedicated route keeps blocked-state logic isolated from normal billing/settings pages and simplifies allowlisting.

#### Implementation impact
- Add route/page for subscription payment update flow.
- Route allowlist while blocked must include `/subscription/update-payment`.
- Portal return URL should target `/subscription/update-payment`.

### DL-2026-02-14-055: Provide minimal admin_dev Stripe Ops observability page without credential editing
- Domain: SaaS Ops
- State: accepted
- Source: Chat Q&A (2026-02-14)
- Supersedes: -
- Superseded by: -
- Date created: 2026-02-14
- Locked at: -

#### Decision
Build a dev-only (`admin_dev`) Stripe Ops page focused on observability and diagnostics, while keeping Stripe account settings, credentials, and key management outside the app.

#### Why
This gives operational visibility for troubleshooting and status checks without introducing security risk from in-app credential editing.

#### Implementation impact
- Add a restricted `admin_dev` route/page for Stripe observability.
- Include read-mostly data (subscription state lookups, webhook processing health, links to Stripe objects).
- Exclude any in-app editing of Stripe API keys or account-level credential material.

## Supersession example

If `DL-2026-02-14-010` needs to change after it is locked:

1. Keep `DL-2026-02-14-010` unchanged.
2. Add `DL-2026-03-01-002` with `supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-010`.
3. Mark `DL-2026-02-14-010` state as `superseded` (metadata-only state transition).
