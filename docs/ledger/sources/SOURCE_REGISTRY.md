# Ledger Source Registry

This registry tracks source artifacts used to derive locked decisions.

## Active canonical source location

- Preferred folder for new source artifacts: `docs/ledger/sources/`
- Naming convention:
  - `LOCKED_DECISION_SOURCE_<TOPIC_SLUG>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_chat-<chat-id>.md`

## Migration policy

1. Do not delete legacy source artifacts that are referenced by existing decisions.
2. New imports should write canonical source files under `docs/ledger/sources/`.
3. If legacy paths are superseded later, add new decisions with updated source references rather than rewriting locked decision bodies.
