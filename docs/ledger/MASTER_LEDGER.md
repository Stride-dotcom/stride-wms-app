# Master Decision Ledger (Packet-Based)

Last updated: 2026-02-15

## Status

This file is maintained by packet application workflow.

- Source artifacts: `docs/ledger/sources/*`
- Pending packets: `docs/ledger/packets/pending/*`
- Applied packets: `docs/ledger/packets/applied/*`

## Migration note

Legacy files remain available for historical context:

- `docs/LOCKED_DECISION_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/LOCKED_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`

New chat updates should be captured via packet files and validated with:

```bash
npm run ledger:apply-packets:dry-run
```
