  glAccountCode: 'General Ledger account code for accounting system export (e.g., QuickBooks). Optional — only needed if you sync billing data to an external accounting system.',
  description: 'Brief description that appears on invoices and reports below the service name. Helps customers understand what this charge is for.',

  // === Add Service Form: Step 2 ===
  chargeCategory: 'Organizes this service in menus, filters, and reports. Categories are for display only — they do NOT affect billing calculations or automated workflows. You can manage categories in the Categories tab.',
  billingTrigger: 'Controls WHEN the system automatically creates a charge. This determines the automation behavior. A charge can always be added manually or via Scan Hub regardless of this setting.',
  triggerAuto: 'Charge is automatically created when an item is received or processed through the receiving workflow.',
  triggerTask: 'Charge is automatically created when the linked task is marked as complete.',
  triggerShipment: 'Charge is automatically created when an outbound shipment is completed.',

  classBasedPricing: 'Different rates for each item class. When an item is billed, the system looks up its class and applies the matching rate. Useful when some items cost more to handle than others.',
  flatPerItem: 'Same rate for every item regardless of its class. Simple and predictable — good for services where item type does not affect the cost.',
  flatPerTask: 'One flat charge for the entire task or job, not per item. Best for fixed-scope work like inspections or audits.',
  unitPrice: 'Direct price per unit. Used for materials, parts, packaging, and other items billed by quantity.',
  minimumCharge: 'Floor amount charged even if the calculated rate is lower. Protects against unprofitable small orders. Example: if a class rate is $2/item and minimum is $15, a 3-item order ($6 calculated) would be charged $15 instead.',

  scanHubToggle: 'When enabled, this service appears as a scannable option in the Scan Hub. Workers can apply this charge by scanning an item and selecting the service.',
  flagToggle: 'Creates a checkbox on item detail pages. When a worker checks the flag, configured actions happen automatically (add charge, alert office, add service time). Example: a "No ID" flag that automatically adds a $15 processing charge.',

  classAlertOnReceive: 'When an item of this class is received, send an alert to the organization contact email. Useful for high-value or oversized items that need special attention.',
  classExplanation: 'Classes let you group items so different groups can have different rates. You define the groups — the system applies the right rate automatically. You can classify by size, value, handling needs, or anything that makes sense for your business.',
