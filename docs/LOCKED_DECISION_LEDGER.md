# Locked Decision Ledger

Last updated: 2026-02-14
Owner: Builders / Developers
Scope: Development artifact only (not an app feature)

## Purpose

This file is the authoritative, human-readable decision ledger for build work.
It captures high-impact implementation decisions, their status, and supersession chain.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Editable until locked**: A decision can be edited while in `draft` or `accepted`.
2. **Locked means immutable**: Once state is `locked`, do not edit decision content in place.
3. **Changes after lock require supersession**: Create a new decision and reference `supersedes`.
4. **Append-only implementation tracking**: Progress is logged in `docs/LOCKED_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
5. **Decision source required**: Each decision must reference source material (Q&A, plan doc, PDF, issue).
6. **Docs-only system**: Ledger lives in this GitHub repo under `docs/` for builders/developers.

## Decision lifecycle states

- `draft`: captured candidate, still being refined
- `accepted`: approved for implementation, still editable
- `locked`: final and immutable
- `superseded`: replaced by another decision
- `rejected`: intentionally not adopted

## Decision index

| Decision ID | Title | Domain | State | Source | Supersedes | Locked At |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL-2026-02-14-001 | Phase 5 v3 implementation record is authoritative for SaaS subscription automation | SaaS Subscription | locked | `uploads/Stride_SaaS_Authoritative_Implementation_Record_Phase5v3.pdf` | - | 2026-02-14 |
| DL-2026-02-14-002 | Ledger is a developer artifact in `docs/`, not an in-app feature | Governance | locked | Chat Q&A (2026-02-14) | - | 2026-02-14 |
| DL-2026-02-14-003 | Decisions are editable until locked; locked decisions are immutable | Governance | locked | Chat Q&A (2026-02-14) | - | 2026-02-14 |
| DL-2026-02-14-004 | Any post-lock change must use a new superseding decision | Governance | locked | Chat Q&A (2026-02-14) | - | 2026-02-14 |

## Decision entry template (copy/paste)

```md
### <Decision ID>: <Short title>
- Domain: <Module or cross-cutting area>
- State: <draft|accepted|locked|superseded|rejected>
- Source: <links/paths to Q&A, docs, issue, PR>
- Supersedes: <Decision ID or ->
- Superseded by: <Decision ID or ->
- Date created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Locked at: <YYYY-MM-DD or ->

#### Decision
<single clear statement of what was decided>

#### Why
<rationale and constraints>

#### Implementation impact
<files/modules/routes/tables affected>

#### Notes
<optional>
```

## Supersession example

If `DL-2026-02-14-010` needs to change after it is locked:

1. Keep `DL-2026-02-14-010` unchanged.
2. Add `DL-2026-03-01-002` with `supersedes: DL-2026-02-14-010`.
3. Mark `DL-2026-02-14-010` state as `superseded` (metadata-only state transition).
